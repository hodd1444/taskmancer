# Welcome to TaskMancer

TaskMancer is a simple python task manager I created for myself. It's currently not finished, but feel free to test it out.

# Installation

### 1. Clone the git repository into any folder
```
git clone https://github.com/hodd1444/taskmancer
```

### 2. Switch directory to where you installed TaskMancer
```
cd taskmancer
```

### 3. Run the install_requirements.sh-Script
```
./install_requirements.sh
```
(You might have to change the files permissions for your user first with `chmod +x install_requirements.sh`)


This is a very useless Task Manager thus far, but I will be developing this to look nice and have more functionality
